Python, Machine Learning, Pandas,  numpy,  Seaborn , Matplotlib ,  Scikitlearn, Jupyter notebook


**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing vaccination-related data to predict vaccination outcomes. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to uncover key insights and create a predictive model for vaccination predictions.

**Features**

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Manage missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistics to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Building Predictive Models:** Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict vaccination outcomes.


**Project Workflow**

- **Data Collection:** Load the dataset into a structured format (e.g., CSV or database).
- **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize feature distributions.
   - Explore correlations and feature importance.
  
- **Model Training:**
  - Implement classification models such as logistic regression, random forests, or XGBoost.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.
  
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Final Conclusion:**
- The Gradient Boosting Classifier excels in predicting both H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination uptake, achieving high F1 Scores (89.17% for H1N1 and 82.97% for Seasonal) and strong ROC AUC values (86.69% for H1N1 and 85.72% for Seasonal).
- Important factors for deciding to get vaccinated include having a young child, being a health worker, going outside often, having chronic health issues, and getting advice from doctors. Other factors like household setup, health insurance, and beliefs about vaccine safety also play a role, but are less important.

  The project offers a detailed analysis of vaccination prediction data, highlighting the key factors influencing vaccination uptake. These insights are valuable for informing public 
  health strategies and enhancing vaccination rates
